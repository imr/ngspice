This file contains a list of known but not yet fixed bugs in ngspice.
===========================================================================

How to submit a bug report:

There are two methods to report a bug you have discovered in ngspice:

    * Bug tracker: This is the preferred method of reporting a bug.
      Using the tracker on Sourceforge.net site will make your report
      open by everyone and the chances of finding a fix will increase.

    * ngspice-devel list: If you are a member of this list, you can write
      directly to the developers' list. Do not subscribe to the list only
      for sending bug reports.

Before sending a bug report please note: all information you send to the bug
tracking system or on the mailing lists is public. If you need to send
sensitive information, send them to a developer directly but still write non
sensitive data on the bug tracking system to keep track of bug history.

* please refer to the sourceforge bug tracker at
  http://sourceforge.net/p/ngspice/bugs/

OPEN BUGS:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* pole-zero analysis

  The pole-zero (.pz) analysis, which still uses the original spice3f5
  algorithms, does not give correct results for all tested input files.
  The effort to correct that issue seems to be large.


* voltage (and current) controlled switches need better timing

  The controlled switches (SW, CSW), which still stem from the original
  spice3f5 implementation, sometimes lead to wrong results when on and off
  ramp times differ considerably.
