TEXT: H      SPICE is a general-purpose circuit  simulation  program
TEXT: H for  nonlinear  dc,  nonlinear transient, and linear ac ana-
TEXT: H lyses.  Circuits may contain resistors,  capacitors,  induc-
TEXT: H tors,  mutual  inductors,  independent  voltage  and current
TEXT: H sources, four types of dependent sources, lossless and lossy
TEXT: H transmission lines (two separate implementations), switches,
TEXT: H uniform distributed RC lines, and the five most common  sem-
TEXT: H iconductor  devices:  diodes, BJTs, JFETs, MESFETs, and MOS-
TEXT: H FETs.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      The SPICE3 version is based  directly  on  SPICE  2G.6.
TEXT: H While  SPICE3 is being developed to include new features, it
TEXT: H continues to support those  capabilities  and  models  which
TEXT: H remain in extensive use in the SPICE2 program.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      SPICE has built-in models for  the  semiconductor  dev-
TEXT: H ices,  and  the  user  need specify only the pertinent model
TEXT: H parameter values.  The model for the BJT  is  based  on  the
TEXT: H integral-charge  model  of Gummel and Poon;  however, if the
TEXT: H Gummel- Poon parameters are not specified, the model reduces
TEXT: H to  the  simpler  Ebers-Moll model.  In either case, charge-
TEXT: H storage effects, ohmic resistances, and a  current-dependent
TEXT: H output  conductance may be included.  The diode model can be
TEXT: H used for either junction diodes or Schottky barrier  diodes.
TEXT: H The  JFET  model  is  based on the FET model of Shichman and
TEXT: H Hodges.   Six  MOSFET  models  are  implemented:   MOS1   is
TEXT: H described by a square-law I-V characteristic, MOS2 [1] is an
TEXT: H analytical model, while MOS3 [1] is a semi-empirical  model;
TEXT: H MOS6  [2]  is a simple analytic model accurate in the short-
TEXT: H channel region; MOS4 [3,  4]  and  MOS5  [5]  are  the  BSIM
TEXT: H (Berkeley Short-channel IGFET Model) and BSIM2.  MOS2, MOS3,
TEXT: H and MOS4 include second-order effects such as channel-length
TEXT: H modulation,   subthreshold   conduction,  scattering-limited
TEXT: H velocity  saturation,  small-size   effects,   and   charge-

TEXT: H      The dc analysis portion  of  SPICE  determines  the  dc
TEXT: H operating  point  of  the circuit with inductors shorted and
TEXT: H capacitors opened.  The dc analysis options are specified on
TEXT: H the  .DC,  .TF,  and  .OP  control  lines.  A dc analysis is
TEXT: H automatically performed prior to  a  transient  analysis  to
TEXT: H determine  the transient initial conditions, and prior to an
TEXT: H ac  small-signal  analysis  to  determine  the   linearized,
TEXT: H small-signal  models  for  nonlinear devices.  If requested,
TEXT: H the dc small-signal value of a transfer function  (ratio  of
TEXT: H output variable to input source), input resistance, and out-
TEXT: H put resistance is also computed as a part of  the  dc  solu-
TEXT: H tion.   The  dc  analysis  can  also  be used to generate dc

TEXT: H
TEXT: H      The ac small-signal portion of SPICE  computes  the  ac
TEXT: H output  variables  as  a function of frequency.  The program
TEXT: H first computes the dc operating point  of  the  circuit  and
TEXT: H determines  linearized,  small-signal  models for all of the
TEXT: H nonlinear devices in the circuit.  The resultant linear cir-
TEXT: H cuit  is  then  analyzed over a user-specified range of fre-
TEXT: H quencies.   The  desired  output  of  an  ac  small-  signal
TEXT: H analysis is usually a transfer function (voltage gain, tran-
TEXT: H simpedance, etc).  If the circuit has only one ac input,  it
TEXT: H is  convenient to set that input to unity and zero phase, so

TEXT: H
TEXT: H      The pole-zero analysis portion of  SPICE  computes  the
TEXT: H poles and/or zeros in the small-signal ac transfer function.
TEXT: H The program first computes the dc operating point  and  then
TEXT: H determines  the  linearized, small-signal models for all the
TEXT: H nonlinear devices in the circuit.  This circuit is then used
TEXT: H to find the poles and zeros of the transfer function.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      Two types of transfer functions are allowed  :  one  of
TEXT: H the  form  (output voltage)/(input voltage) and the other of
TEXT: H the form (output voltage)/(input current).  These two  types
TEXT: H of  transfer  functions cover all the cases and one can find
TEXT: H the poles/zeros of functions like input/output impedance and
TEXT: H voltage  gain.   The input and output ports are specified as
TEXT: H two pairs of nodes.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      The pole-zero analysis works  with  resistors,  capaci-
TEXT: H tors,   inductors,  linear-controlled  sources,  independent
TEXT: H sources, BJTs,  MOSFETs,  JFETs  and  diodes.   Transmission
TEXT: H lines are not supported.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      The method used in the analysis is a sub-optimal numer-
TEXT: H ical  search.  For large circuits it may take a considerable
TEXT: H time or fail to find all poles and  zeros.   For  some  cir-
TEXT: H cuits,  the  method  becomes  "lost"  and finds an excessive
TEXT: H number of poles or zeros.

TEXT: H
TEXT: H      The  distortion  analysis  portion  of  SPICE  computes
TEXT: H steady-state harmonic and intermodulation products for small
TEXT: H input signal magnitudes.  If signals of a  single  frequency
TEXT: H are  specified  as  the  input  to  the circuit, the complex
TEXT: H values of the second and third harmonics are  determined  at
TEXT: H every  point  in  the  circuit.  If there are signals of two
TEXT: H frequencies input to the circuit, the analysis finds out the
TEXT: H complex  values  of  the  circuit  variables  at the sum and
TEXT: H difference of the input frequencies, and at  the  difference
TEXT: H of  the  smaller  frequency  from the second harmonic of the
TEXT: H larger frequency.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      Distortion analysis is supported for the following non-
TEXT: H linear  devices: diodes (DIO), BJT, JFET, MOSFETs (levels 1,
TEXT: H 2, 3, 4/BSIM1, 5/BSIM2, and 6) and MESFETS.  All linear dev-
TEXT: H ices are automatically supported by distortion analysis.  If

TEXT: H sensitivity  or the AC small-signal sensitivity of an output
TEXT: H variable with respect to all  circuit  variables,  including
TEXT: H model  parameters.   Spice  calculates  the difference in an
TEXT: H output variable (either a node voltage or a branch  current)
TEXT: H by  perturbing  each parameter of each device independently.
TEXT: H Since the method is a numerical approximation,  the  results
TEXT: H may  demonstrate  second  order  effects in highly sensitive
TEXT: H parameters, or may fail to show very low but non-zero sensi-
TEXT: H tivity.   Further, since each variable is perturb by a small

TEXT: H device-generated noise for the given circuit.  When provided

TEXT: H also  calculates  the input noise to the circuit, equivalent

TEXT: H This  is done for every frequency point in a specified range

TEXT: H
TEXT: H      After  calculating  the   spectral   densities,   noise
TEXT: H analysis  integrates  these  values  over the specified fre-
TEXT: H quency range to arrive at the  total  noise  voltage/current
TEXT: H (over   this   frequency   range).   This  calculated  value

TEXT: H      The circuit to be analyzed is described to SPICE  by  a
TEXT: H set  of element lines, which define the circuit topology and
TEXT: H element values, and a set of control lines, which define the
TEXT: H model  parameters  and  the run controls.  The first line in
TEXT: H the input file must be the title, and the last line must  be
TEXT: H ".END".   The  order  of  the  remaining  lines is arbitrary
TEXT: H (except, of course, that continuation lines must immediately
TEXT: H follow the line being continued).
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      Each element in the circuit is specified by an  element
TEXT: H line  that  contains  the element name, the circuit nodes to
TEXT: H which the element is connected, and the values of the param-
TEXT: H eters  that  determine the electrical characteristics of the
TEXT: H element.  The first letter of the element name specifies the
TEXT: H element  type.   The  format  for the SPICE element types is
TEXT: H given in what follows.  The strings  XXXXXXX,  YYYYYYY,  and
TEXT: H ZZZZZZZ denote arbitrary alphanumeric strings.  For example,
TEXT: H a resistor name must begin with the letter R and can contain
TEXT: H one  or  more  characters.   Hence,  R,  R1,  RSE, ROUT, and
TEXT: H R3AC2ZY are valid resistor names.  Details of each  type  of
TEXT: H device are supplied in a following section.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      Fields on a line are separated by one or more blanks, a
TEXT: H comma,  an equal ('=') sign, or a left or right parenthesis;
TEXT: H extra spaces are ignored.  A line may be continued by enter-
TEXT: H ing  a  '+'  (plus) in column 1 of the following line; SPICE
TEXT: H continues reading beginning with column 2.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      A name field must begin with a letter (A through Z) and
TEXT: H cannot contain any delimiters.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      A number field may be an integer  field  (12,  -44),  a
TEXT: H floating  point field (3.14159), either an integer or float-
TEXT: H ing point number followed by  an  integer  exponent  (1e-14,
TEXT: H 2.65e3),  or  either  an  integer or a floating point number
TEXT: H followed by one of the following scale factors:

TEXT: H
TEXT: H Letters immediately following a number that  are  not  scale
TEXT: H factors  are  ignored,  and  letters immediately following a
TEXT: H scale factor are ignored.  Hence, 10, 10V, 10Volts, and 10Hz
TEXT: H all  represent  the  same number, and M, MA, MSec, and MMhos
TEXT: H all represent  the  same  scale  factor.   Note  that  1000,
TEXT: H 1000.0,  1000Hz,  1e3, 1.0e3, 1KHz, and 1K all represent the
TEXT: H same number.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      Nodes names may be arbitrary  character  strings.   The
TEXT: H datum  (ground) node must be named '0'.  Note the difference
TEXT: H in SPICE3 where the nodes are treated as  character  strings
TEXT: H and not evaluated as numbers, thus '0' and '00' are distinct
TEXT: H nodes in SPICE3 but not in SPICE2.  The circuit cannot  con-
TEXT: H tain  a  loop of voltage sources and/or inductors and cannot
TEXT: H contain a cut-set  of  current  sources  and/or  capacitors.
TEXT: H Each  node  in  the  circuit  must have a dc path to ground.
TEXT: H Every node must have at least  two  connections  except  for
TEXT: H transmission line nodes (to permit unterminated transmission
TEXT: H lines) and MOSFET substrate nodes (which have  two  internal
TEXT: H connections anyway).

TEXT: H      Most simple circuit elements typically require  only  a
TEXT: H few  parameter values.  However, some devices (semiconductor
TEXT: H devices in particular) that are included  in  SPICE  require
TEXT: H many parameter values.  Often, many devices in a circuit are
TEXT: H defined by the same set of  device  model  parameters.   For
TEXT: H these  reasons,  a set of device model parameters is defined
TEXT: H on a separate .MODEL line and assigned a unique model  name.
TEXT: H The  device  element  lines in SPICE then refer to the model
TEXT: H name.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      For these more complex device types, each  device  ele-
TEXT: H ment  line  contains the device name, the nodes to which the
TEXT: H device is connected, and the device model  name.   In  addi-
TEXT: H tion,  other  optional  parameters may be specified for some
TEXT: H devices:  geometric factors and an  initial  condition  (see

TEXT: H      The switch model allows an almost ideal  switch  to  be

TEXT: H      The use of an ideal element that  is  highly  nonlinear
TEXT: H such as a switch can cause large discontinuities to occur in
TEXT: H the circuit node voltages.  A  rapid  change  such  as  that
TEXT: H associated  with a switch changing state can cause numerical
TEXT: H roundoff or tolerance problems leading to erroneous  results
TEXT: H or  timestep difficulties.  The user of switches can improve
TEXT: H the situation by taking the following steps:
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      First, it is wise to set ideal switch  impedances  just
TEXT: H high  or  low  enough to be negligible with respect to other
TEXT: H circuit elements.  Using switch impedances that are close to
TEXT: H "ideal"  in all cases aggravates the problem of discontinui-
TEXT: H ties mentioned above.  Of course, when modeling real devices
TEXT: H such  as  MOSFETS, the on resistance should be adjusted to a
TEXT: H realistic level depending on the size of  the  device  being
TEXT: H modeled.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      If a wide range of ON to OFF resistance must be used in
TEXT: H the switches (ROFF/RON >1e+12), then the tolerance on errors
TEXT: H allowed during transient analysis  should  be  decreased  by
TEXT: H using  the  .OPTIONS control line and specifying TRTOL to be
TEXT: H less than the default  value  of  7.0.   When  switches  are
TEXT: H placed around capacitors, then the option CHGTOL should also
TEXT: H be reduced.  Suggested values for these two options are  1.0
TEXT: H and  1e-16  respectively.  These changes inform SPICE3 to be
TEXT: H more careful around the switch points so that no errors  are
TEXT: H made due to the rapid change in the circuit.

TEXT: H
TEXT: H      The option most worth experimenting with for increasing
TEXT: H the  speed  of simulation is REL.  The default value of 1 is
TEXT: H usually safe from the point of view of  accuracy  but  occa-

TEXT: H eliminates all breakpoints and may be worth trying depending
TEXT: H on  the  nature  of the rest of the circuit, keeping in mind
TEXT: H that it might not be safe from the  viewpoint  of  accuracy.
TEXT: H Breakpoints  may  usually  be  entirely  eliminated if it is
TEXT: H expected the circuit will not display sharp discontinuities.
TEXT: H Values  between  0 and 1 are usually not required but may be

TEXT: H
TEXT: H      COMPACTREL may  also  be  experimented  with  when  the

TEXT: H      The bipolar junction transistor model in  SPICE  is  an
TEXT: H adaptation  of  the  integral charge control model of Gummel
TEXT: H and Poon.  This modified Gummel-Poon model extends the  ori-
TEXT: H ginal  model to include several effects at high bias levels.
TEXT: H The model automatically simplifies to the simpler Ebers-Moll
TEXT: H model when certain parameters are not specified.  The param-
TEXT: H eter names used in the modified Gummel-Poon model have  been
TEXT: H chosen to be more easily understood by the program user, and
TEXT: H to reflect better both physical and circuit design thinking.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      The dc model is defined by the parameters IS,  BF,  NF,
TEXT: H ISE,  IKF,  and  NE which determine the forward current gain
TEXT: H characteristics, IS, BR, NR, ISC, IKR, and NC  which  deter-
TEXT: H mine  the  reverse current gain characteristics, and VAF and
TEXT: H VAR which determine the output conductance for  forward  and
TEXT: H reverse regions.  Three ohmic resistances RB, RC, and RE are
TEXT: H included, where RB can  be  high  current  dependent.   Base
TEXT: H charge  storage  is  modeled  by forward and reverse transit
TEXT: H times, TF and TR, the forward transit  time  TF  being  bias

TEXT: H junction  ,  CJC, VJC, and MJC for the B-C junction and CJS,
TEXT: H VJS, and MJS for  the  C-S  (Collector-Substrate)  junction.
TEXT: H The temperature dependence of the saturation current, IS, is
TEXT: H determined by the energy-gap, EG, and the saturation current
TEXT: H temperature  exponent,  XTI.  Additionally base current tem-
TEXT: H perature dependence  is  modeled  by  the  beta  temperature
TEXT: H exponent  XTB  in  the  new model.  The values specified are
TEXT: H assumed to have been measured at the temperature TNOM, which

TEXT: H      There is some overlap among the  parameters  describing

TEXT: H                              2
TEXT: H as IS (in A) or as JS (in A/m ). Whereas  the  first  is  an
TEXT: H absolute value the second is multiplied by AD and AS to give
TEXT: H the reverse  current  of  the  drain  and  source  junctions
TEXT: H respectively.   This methodology has been chosen since there

TEXT: H      The IC line is for  setting  transient  initial  condi-
TEXT: H tions.   It  has two different interpretations, depending on
TEXT: H whether the UIC parameter is specified on the .TRAN  control
TEXT: H line.   Also,  one  should  not  confuse  this line with the
TEXT: H .NODESET line.  The .NODESET line is only to help dc conver-
TEXT: H gence,  and  does not affect final bias solution (except for
TEXT: H multi-stable circuits).  The  two  interpretations  of  this
TEXT: H line are as follows:
TEXT: H
TEXT: H  1.  When the UIC parameter is specified on the .TRAN  line,
TEXT: H then the node voltages specified on the .IC control line are
TEXT: H used to compute the capacitor, diode, BJT, JFET, and  MOSFET
TEXT: H initial  conditions.   This  is equivalent to specifying the
TEXT: H IC=... parameter on each device line, but is much more  con-
TEXT: H venient.   The  IC=...  parameter can still be specified and
TEXT: H takes precedence over the .IC  values.   Since  no  dc  bias
TEXT: H (initial  transient)  solution  is computed before the tran-
TEXT: H sient analysis, one should  take  care  to  specify  all  dc
TEXT: H source  voltages  on  the .IC control line if they are to be
TEXT: H used to compute device initial conditions.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H  2.  When the UIC parameter is not specified  on  the  .TRAN
TEXT: H control  line,  the  dc bias (initial transient) solution is
TEXT: H computed before the transient analysis.  In this  case,  the
TEXT: H node voltages specified on the .IC control line is forced to
TEXT: H the desired initial values during the bias solution.  During
TEXT: H transient analysis, the constraint on these node voltages is
TEXT: H removed.  This is the preferred method since it allows SPICE
TEXT: H to compute a consistent dc solution.

TEXT: H
TEXT: H      If the optional parameter F2OVERF1  is  not  specified,
TEXT: H .DISTO  does a harmonic analysis - i.e., it analyses distor-
TEXT: H tion in the circuit using only a single input frequency  F1,
TEXT: H which  is swept as specified by arguments of the .DISTO com-
TEXT: H mand exactly as in the .AC command.   Inputs  at  this  fre-
TEXT: H quency  may  be  present  at more than one input source, and
TEXT: H their magnitudes and phases are specified by  the  arguments
TEXT: H of the DISTOF1 keyword in the input file lines for the input
TEXT: H sources (see the description for independent sources).  (The
TEXT: H arguments  of  the  DISTOF2 keyword are not relevant in this
TEXT: H case).  The analysis produces  information  about  the  A.C.
TEXT: H values  of all node voltages and branch currents at the har-
TEXT: H monic frequencies 2F1 and 3F1, vs. the input frequency F1 as
TEXT: H it is swept.  (A value of 1 (as a complex distortion output)
TEXT: H signifies cos(2J(2F1)t) at 2F1  and  cos(2J(3F1)t)  at  3F1,
TEXT: H using  the  convention  that 1 at the input fundamental fre-
TEXT: H quency is equivalent to  cos(2JF1t).)  The  distortion  com-
TEXT: H ponent  desired  (2F1 or 3F1) can be selected using commands
TEXT: H in nutmeg, and then printed or plotted.  (Normally,  one  is
TEXT: H interested  primarily  in the magnitude of the harmonic com-
TEXT: H ponents, so the magnitude of  the  AC  distortion  value  is
TEXT: H looked  at).   It  should  be  noted that these are the A.C.
TEXT: H values of the actual harmonic components, and are not  equal
TEXT: H to  HD2  and HD3.  To obtain HD2 and HD3, one must divide by
TEXT: H the corresponding A.C. values at F1, obtained  from  an  .AC
TEXT: H line.  This division can be done using nutmeg commands.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      If the optional F2OVERF1  parameter  is  specified,  it
TEXT: H should  be  a real number between (and not equal to) 0.0 and
TEXT: H 1.0; in this case, .DISTO does a spectral analysis.  It con-
TEXT: H siders  the  circuit with sinusoidal inputs at two different
TEXT: H frequencies F1 and F2.  F1 is swept according to the  .DISTO
TEXT: H control line options exactly as in the .AC control line.  F2
TEXT: H is kept fixed at a single frequency as F1 sweeps - the value
TEXT: H at which it is kept fixed is equal to F2OVERF1 times FSTART.
TEXT: H Each independent source in the circuit may potentially  have
TEXT: H two  (superimposed) sinusoidal inputs for distortion, at the
TEXT: H frequencies F1 and F2.  The magnitude and phase  of  the  F1
TEXT: H component are specified by the arguments of the DISTOF1 key-
TEXT: H word in the source's input  line  (see  the  description  of
TEXT: H independent sources); the magnitude and phase of the F2 com-
TEXT: H ponent are specified by the arguments of  the  DISTOF2  key-
TEXT: H word.    The   analysis   produces   plots   of   all   node
TEXT: H voltages/branch currents at the intermodulation product fre-
TEXT: H quencies  F1  +  F2,  F1 - F2, and (2 F1) - F2, vs the swept
TEXT: H frequency F1.  The IM product of interest  may  be  selected
TEXT: H using  the setplot command, and displayed with the print and
TEXT: H plot commands.  It  is  to  be  noted  as  in  the  harmonic
TEXT: H analysis  case,  the  results are the actual AC voltages and
TEXT: H currents at the intermodulation frequencies, and need to  be
TEXT: H normalized  with  respect  to  .AC  values  to obtain the IM
TEXT: H parameters.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      If the DISTOF1 or DISTOF2 keywords are missing from the
TEXT: H description  of  an  independent source, then that source is
TEXT: H assumed to have no input  at  the  corresponding  frequency.
TEXT: H The  default  values  of the magnitude and phase are 1.0 and
TEXT: H 0.0 respectively.  The phase should be specified in degrees.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      It should be carefully noted that the  number  F2OVERF1
TEXT: H should  ideally be an irrational number, and that since this
TEXT: H is not possible in practice, efforts should be made to  keep
TEXT: H the denominator in its fractional representation as large as
TEXT: H possible, certainly above 3, for accurate results (i.e.,  if
TEXT: H F2OVERF1 is represented as a fraction A/B, where A and B are
TEXT: H integers with no common factors, B should  be  as  large  as
TEXT: H possible; note that A < B because F2OVERF1 is constrained to
TEXT: H be < 1).   To  illustrate  why,  consider  the  cases  where
TEXT: H F2OVERF1  is  49/100  and  1/2.  In a spectral analysis, the
TEXT: H outputs produced are at F1 + F2, F1 - F2 and 2 F1 - F2.   In
TEXT: H the  latter  case,  F1 - F2 = F2, so the result at the F1-F2
TEXT: H component is erroneous because there is the strong fundamen-
TEXT: H tal  F2  component at the same frequency.  Also, F1 + F2 = 2
TEXT: H F1 - F2 in the latter case, and  each  result  is  erroneous
TEXT: H individually.   This  problem is not there in the case where
TEXT: H F2OVERF1 = 49/100, because F1-F2 = 51/100 F1 < > 49/100 F1 =
TEXT: H F2.   In  this  case, there are two very closely spaced fre-
TEXT: H quency components at F2 and F1 - F2.  One of the  advantages
TEXT: H of the Volterra series technique is that it computes distor-
TEXT: H tions at mix frequencies expressed symbolically (i.e. n F1 +
TEXT: H m F2), therefore one is able to obtain the strengths of dis-
TEXT: H tortion components accurately even if the separation between
TEXT: H them  is  very  small,  as opposed to transient analysis for
TEXT: H example.  The disadvantage is of course that if two  of  the
TEXT: H mix   frequencies  coincide,  the  results  are  not  merged
TEXT: H together and presented (though this could presumably be done
TEXT: H as  a  postprocessing step).  Currently, the interested user
TEXT: H should keep track of the mix frequencies himself or  herself
TEXT: H and  add  the  distortions  at  coinciding  mix  frequencies
TEXT: H together should it be necessary.

TEXT: H      TSTEP is the printing or plotting increment  for  line-
TEXT: H printer  output.   For use with the post-processor, TSTEP is
TEXT: H the suggested computing increment.  TSTOP is the final time,
TEXT: H and TSTART is the initial time.  If TSTART is omitted, it is
TEXT: H assumed to be zero.  The transient analysis always begins at
TEXT: H time  zero.   In the interval <zero, TSTART>, the circuit is
TEXT: H analyzed (to reach a  steady  state),  but  no  outputs  are
TEXT: H stored.   In  the  interval  <TSTART, TSTOP>, the circuit is
TEXT: H analyzed and outputs are stored.  TMAX is the maximum  step-
TEXT: H size  that  SPICE  uses;  for  default,  the program chooses
TEXT: H either TSTEP or (TSTOP-TSTART)/50.0, whichever  is  smaller.
TEXT: H TMAX  is  useful  when  one  wishes to guarantee a computing

TEXT: H      Spice and Nutmeg data is in the form of vectors:  time,

TEXT: H      An expression is an algebraic formula involving vectors

TEXT: H                   +   -    *    /    ^   %
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H % is the modulo operator, and the  comma  operator  has  two
TEXT: H meanings:  if  it is present in the argument list of a user-
TEXT: H definable function, it serves  to  separate  the  arguments.
TEXT: H Otherwise, the term x , y is synonymous with x + j(y).
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      Also available are the logical operations  &  (and),  |
TEXT: H (or),  !  (not), and the relational operations <, >, >=, <=,
TEXT: H =, and <> (not equal).  If used in an  algebraic  expression
TEXT: H they  work like they would in C, producing values of 0 or 1.
TEXT: H The relational operators have the following synonyms:
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H                             gt    >

TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      A vector may be either the name  of  a  vector  already
TEXT: H defined or a floating-point number (a scalar).  A number may
TEXT: H be written in  any  format  acceptable  to  SPICE,  such  as
TEXT: H 14.6Meg  or  -1.231e-4.  Note that you can either use scien-
TEXT: H tific notation or one of the abbreviations like  _M_E_G  or  _G,
TEXT: H but  not  both.   As  with SPICE, a number may have trailing
TEXT: H alphabetic characters after it.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      The notation expr [num] denotes the num'th  element  of
TEXT: H expr.   For  multi-dimensional vectors, a vector of one less
TEXT: H dimension is returned.  Also for multi-dimensional  vectors,
TEXT: H the  notation  expr[m][n] will return the _nth element of the
TEXT: H mth subvector.  To get a subrange of a vector, use the  form
TEXT: H expr[lower, upper].
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      To reference vectors in a plot that is not the  _c_u_r_r_e_n_t
TEXT: H _p_l_o_t   (see   the  setplot  command,  below),  the  notation
TEXT: H plotname.vecname can be used.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      Either a plotname or a vector name may be the  wildcard
TEXT: H all.   If  the  plotname  is  all, matching vectors from all
TEXT: H plots are specified, and if the vector name is all, all vec-
TEXT: H tors  in  the specified plots are referenced.  Note that you
TEXT: H may not use binary operations on expressions involving wild-
TEXT: H cards  - it is not obvious what all + all should denote, for
TEXT: H instance.  Thus some  (contrived)  examples  of  expressions
TEXT: H are:
TEXT: H
TEXT: H     cos(TIME) + db(v(3))
TEXT: H     sin(cos(log([1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10])))
TEXT: H     TIME * rnd(v(9)) - 15 * cos(vin#branch) ^ [7.9e5 8]
TEXT: H     not ((ac3.FREQ[32] & tran1.TIME[10]) gt 3)
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      Vector  names  in  spice  may  have  a  name  such   as
TEXT: H @name[param],  where  name  is  either  the name of a device
TEXT: H instance or model.  This denotes  the  value  of  the  param
TEXT: H parameter  of  the  device  or  model.   See  Appendix B for
TEXT: H details of what parameters are available.  The  value  is  a
TEXT: H vector  of  length  1.  This function is also available with
TEXT: H the show command, and is available with variables  for  con-
TEXT: H venience for command scripts.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      There are a number of pre-defined constants in  nutmeg.
TEXT: H They are:
TEXT: H
TEXT: H pi                J (3.14159...)
TEXT: H e                 The base of natural logarithms (2.71828...)
TEXT: H c                 The speed of light (299,792,500 m/sec)
TEXT: H i                 The square root of -1
TEXT: H                                                     o
TEXT: H kelvin            Absolute 0 in Centigrade (-273.15  C)
TEXT: H echarge           The charge on an electron (1.6021918e-19 C)
TEXT: H boltz             Boltzman's constant (1.3806226e-23)
TEXT: H planck            Planck's constant (h = 6.626200e-34)
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      These are all in MKS units.  If you have another  vari-
TEXT: H able  with  a  name that conflicts with one of these then it

TEXT: H
TEXT: H      If a word is typed  as  a  command,  and  there  is  no
TEXT: H built-in  command  with  that  name,  the directories in the
TEXT: H _s_o_u_r_c_e_p_a_t_h list are searched in order for the file.   If  it
TEXT: H is  found,  it  is  read in as a command file (as if it were
TEXT: H sourced).  Before it is read, however,  the  variables  _a_r_g_c
TEXT: H and  _a_r_g_v  are  set  to  the  number  of words following the
TEXT: H filename on the command line, and  a  list  of  those  words
TEXT: H respectively.   After  the file is finished, these variables
TEXT: H are unset.  Note that if a command file  calls  another,  it
TEXT: H must  save  its _a_r_g_v and _a_r_g_c since they are altered.  Also,
TEXT: H command files may not be re-entrant since there are no local
TEXT: H variables.   (Of course, the procedures may explicitly mani-
TEXT: H pulate a stack...) This way one can write scripts  analogous
TEXT: H to shell scripts for nutmeg and Spice3.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      Note that for the script to work with Spice3,  it  must
TEXT: H begin  with  a  blank  line  (or  whatever else, since it is
TEXT: H thrown away) and then a line with .control on it.   This  is
TEXT: H an  unfortunate  result of the source command being used for
TEXT: H both circuit input and command file  execution.   Note  also
TEXT: H that  this allows the user to merely type the name of a cir-
TEXT: H cuit file as a command and it  is  automatically  run.   The
TEXT: H commands  are executed immediately, without running any ana-
TEXT: H lyses that may be spicified in the circuit (to  execute  the
TEXT: H analyses before the script executes, include a "run" command
TEXT: H in the script).
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      There  are  various  command   scripts   installed   in
TEXT: H /_u_s_r/_l_o_c_a_l/_l_i_b/_s_p_i_c_e/_s_c_r_i_p_t_s  (or  whatever  the  path is on
TEXT: H your machine), and  the  default  _s_o_u_r_c_e_p_a_t_h  includes  this

TEXT: H
TEXT: H      If there are subcircuits  in  the  input  file,  Spice3
TEXT: H expands instances of them.  A subcircuit is delimited by the
TEXT: H cards ._s_u_b_c_k_t and ._e_n_d_s, or whatever the value of the  vari-
TEXT: H ables  _s_u_b_s_t_a_r_t and _s_u_b_e_n_d is, respectively.  An instance of
TEXT: H a subcircuit is created by specifying a device with type 'x'
TEXT: H - the device line is written
TEXT: H
TEXT: H     xname node1 node2 ... subcktname
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H where the nodes are the node names that replace  the  formal
TEXT: H parameters on the .subckt line.  All nodes that are not for-
TEXT: H mal parameters are prepended with  the  name  given  to  the
TEXT: H instance  and  a ':', as are the names of the devices in the
TEXT: H subcircuit.  If there are several nested  subcircuits,  node
TEXT: H and device names look like subckt1:subckt2:...:name.  If the
TEXT: H variable subinvoke is set, then it is  used  as  the  prefix
TEXT: H that specifies instances of subcircuits, instead of 'x'.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      Nutmeg occasionally checks to  see  if  it  is  getting
TEXT: H close to running out of space, and warns the user if this is
TEXT: H the case. (This is more likely to be useful with  the  SPICE
TEXT: H front end.)
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      C-shell type quoting with "" and '', and backquote sub-
TEXT: H stitution  may  be  used.   Within single quotes, no further
TEXT: H substitution (like history substitution) is done, and within
TEXT: H double  quotes, the words are kept together but further sub-
TEXT: H stitution is done.  Any text between backquotes is  replaced
TEXT: H by  the  result  of  executing  the text as a command to the
TEXT: H shell.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      Tenex-style ('set filec' in the 4.3  C-shell)  command,
TEXT: H filename,   and  keyword  completion  is  possible:  If  EOF
TEXT: H (control-D) is typed after the first character on the  line,
TEXT: H a  list of the commands or possible arguments is printed (If
TEXT: H it is alone on the line it  exits  nutmeg).   If  escape  is
TEXT: H typed,  then  nutmeg  trys  to  complete  what  the user has
TEXT: H already typed.  To get a list  of  all  commands,  the  user
TEXT: H should type <space> ^D.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      The values of variables may  be  used  in  commands  by
TEXT: H writing  $varname  where  the  value  of  the variable is to
TEXT: H appear.  The special variables $$ and $< refer to  the  pro-
TEXT: H cess  ID  of  the  program and a line of input which is read
TEXT: H from the terminal when the variable  is  evaluated,  respec-
TEXT: H tively.   If  a variable has a name of the form $&word, then
TEXT: H word is considered a vector (see above), and  its  value  is
TEXT: H taken  to  be the value of the variable.  If $_f_o_o is a valid
TEXT: H variable,  and  is  of  type  list,  then   the   expression
TEXT: H $_f_o_o[_l_o_w-_h_i_g_h]  represents  a range of elements.  Either the
TEXT: H upper index or the lower may be left out, and the reverse of
TEXT: H a list may be obtained with $_f_o_o[_l_e_n-_0].  Also, the notation
TEXT: H $?_f_o_o evaluates to 1 if the variable _f_o_o is defined, 0  oth-
TEXT: H erwise, and $#_f_o_o evaluates to the number of elements in _f_o_o
TEXT: H if it is a list, 1 if it is a number or string, and 0 if  it
TEXT: H is a boolean variable.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      History substitutions, similar to C-shell history  sub-
TEXT: H stitutions, are also available - see the C-shell manual page
TEXT: H for all of the details.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      The characters ~, {, and } have  the  same  effects  as
TEXT: H they do in the C-Shell, i.e., home directory and alternative
TEXT: H expansion.  It is possible to use the wildcard characters *,
TEXT: H ?,  [, and ] also, but only if you unset noglob first.  This
TEXT: H makes them rather useless for typing algebraic  expressions,
TEXT: H so you should set noglob again after you are done with wild-
TEXT: H card expansion.  Note that the  pattern  [^abc]  matchs  all
TEXT: H characters _e_x_c_e_p_t a, b, _a_n_d c.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      IO redirection is available - the symbols  >,  >>,  >&,
TEXT: H >>&, and < have the same effects as in the C-shell.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      You may type multiple commands on one  line,  separated
TEXT: H by semicolons.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      If you want to use a different  mfbcap  file  than  the
TEXT: H default  (usually  ~cad/lib/mfbcap),  you  have  to  set the
TEXT: H environment variable SPICE_MFBCAP before you start nutmeg or
TEXT: H spice.   The  -m  option  and  the mfbcap variable no longer
TEXT: H work.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      If X is being used, the cursor may be positioned at any
TEXT: H point  on  the  screen  when the window is up and characters
TEXT: H typed at the keyboard are added to the window at that point.
TEXT: H The  window  may  then be sent to a printer using the xpr(1)
TEXT: H program.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      Nutmeg can be run under VAX/VMS,  as  well  as  several
TEXT: H other operating systems.  Some features like command comple-
TEXT: H tion, expansion of *, ?, and [], backquote substitution, the
TEXT: H shell command, and so forth do not work.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      On some systems you  have  to  respond  to  the  -_m_o_r_e-
TEXT: H prompt during plot with a carriage return instead of any key
TEXT: H as you can do on UNIX.

TEXT: H
TEXT: H      The label entry facilities are primitive.  You must  be
TEXT: H careful to type slowly when entering labels -- nutmeg checks
TEXT: H for input once every second, and can get confused if charac-
TEXT: H ters arrive faster.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      If you redefine colors after  creating  a  plot  window
TEXT: H with X, and then cause the window to be redrawn, it does not
TEXT: H redraw in the correct colors.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      When defining aliases like
TEXT: H
TEXT: H     alias pdb plot db( '!:1' - '!:2' )
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H you must be careful to quote the argument list substitu-
TEXT: H tions  in  this manner.  If you quote the whole argument
TEXT: H it might not work properly.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      In a user-defined function,  the  arguments  cannot  be
TEXT: H part of a name that uses the _p_l_o_t._v_e_c syntax.  For example:
TEXT: H
TEXT: H     define check(v(1)) cos(tran1.v(1))
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H does not work.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      If you type plot all all, or otherwise use  a  wildcard
TEXT: H reference  for  one  plot  twice in a command, the effect is
TEXT: H unpredictable.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      The asciiplot command doesn't deal with log  scales  or
TEXT: H the delta keywords.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      Often the names of terminals recognized by MFB are dif-
TEXT: H ferent  from  those  in  /etc/termcap.  Thus you may have to
TEXT: H reset your terminal type with the command
TEXT: H
TEXT: H     set term = termname
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H where termname is the name in the mfbcap file.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      The hardcopy command is useless on VMS and  other  sys-
TEXT: H tems without the plot command, unless the user has a program
TEXT: H that understands _p_l_o_t(_5) format.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      Spice3 recognizes all  the  notations  used  in  SPICE2
TEXT: H .plot  cards,  and  translates  vp(1)  into ph(v(1)), and so
TEXT: H forth.  However, if there are spaces in these names it won't
TEXT: H work.  Hence v(1, 2) and (-.5, .5) aren't recognized.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      BJTs can have either 3 or 4 nodes, which makes it  dif-
TEXT: H ficult  for the subcircuit expansion routines to decide what
TEXT: H to rename.  If the fourth parameter has been declared  as  a
TEXT: H model  name, then it is assumed that there are 3 nodes, oth-
TEXT: H erwise it is considered a node.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      The @name[param] notation might not  work  with  trace,
TEXT: H iplot, etc.  yet.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      The first line of a command file (except for the  ._s_p_i_-
TEXT: H _c_e_i_n_i_t file) should be a comment, otherwise SPICE may create
TEXT: H an empty circuit.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      Files specified on the command  line  are  read  before
TEXT: H .spiceinit is read.

TEXT: H
TEXT: H      The following tables summarize the parameters available
TEXT: H on  each  of  the devices and models in  (note that for some
TEXT: H systems with  limited  memory,  output  parameters  are  not
TEXT: H available).   There are several tables for each type of dev-
TEXT: H ice supported by .  Input parameters to instances and models
TEXT: H are parameters that can occur on an instance or model defin-
TEXT: H ition line in the form "keyword=value"  where  "keyword"  is
TEXT: H the  parameter  name  as given in the tables.  Default input
TEXT: H parameters (such as the resistance  of  a  resistor  or  the
TEXT: H capacitance  of  a capacitor) obviously do not need the key-
TEXT: H word specified.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      Output parameters are those additional parameters which
TEXT: H are  available for many types of instances for the output of
TEXT: H operating point and debugging information.  These parameters
TEXT: H are  specified  as  "@device[keyword]" and are available for
TEXT: H the most recent point computed or, if specified in a ".save"
TEXT: H statement,  for an entire simulation as a normal output vec-
TEXT: H tor.  Thus, to monitor the gate-to-source capacitance  of  a
TEXT: H MOSFET, a command
TEXT: H
TEXT: H         save @m1[cgs]
TEXT: H
TEXT: H given before a transient  simulation  causes  the  specified
TEXT: H capacitance  value to be saved at each timepoint, and a sub-
TEXT: H sequent command such as
TEXT: H
TEXT: H         plot @m1[cgs]
TEXT: H
TEXT: H produces the desired plot.  (Note that the show command does
TEXT: H not use this format).
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      Some variables are listed as both input and output, and
TEXT: H their  output  simply returns the previously input value, or
TEXT: H the default value after the simulation has been  run.   Some
TEXT: H parameter  are  input only because the output system can not
TEXT: H handle variables of the given type yet, or the need for them
TEXT: H as  output variables has not been apparent.  Many such input
TEXT: H variables are available as output variables in  a  different
TEXT: H format,  such  as  the initial condition vectors that can be
TEXT: H retrieved as individual initial condition values.   Finally,
TEXT: H internally  derived  values are output only and are provided
TEXT: H for debugging and operating point output purposes.
TEXT: H
TEXT: H      Please note  that  these  tables  do  not  provide  the
TEXT: H detailed information available about the parameters provided
TEXT: H in the section on each device and model, but are provided as
