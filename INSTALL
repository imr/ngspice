1 Ngspice Installation
  ====================

1.1 Prerequisites

     Ngspice is written in C and thus a complete C compilation environment is 
 needed. Almost any UNIX comes with a complete C development environment.
 Ngspice is developed on GNU/Linux with gcc and GNU make.  

 The following software must be installed in your system to compile ngspice: 
 bison, flex and X11.

 If you want to compile the CVS source you need additional software:
 autoconf, automake, libtool, texinfo. 

 The following software may be needed when enabling additional features:
 editline, tcl/tk

1.2 Install from CVS

     This section describes how to install from source code taken direct
 from CVS.  It is intended more for developers than for users as the code 
 in CVS may be unstable. For user install instructions using source from 
 released distributions, please see the sections titled 'Basic Install' 
 and 'Advanced Install'.

 Download source from CVS as described on the sourceforge project page
 (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/ and click on the CVS link)

 Now change directories in to the top-level source directory (where this
 INSTALL file can be found).

 The project uses the GNU build process. This is still very crude and needs
 work, but basically you should be able to do the following:

 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
 $ make
 $ sudo make install

 At present it is normal for there to be some warning generated during this
 process.
	
 See the section titled 'Advanced Install' for instructions about arguments 
 that can be passed to ./configure to customise the build and installation.

     If a problem is found with the build proccess, please submit a report to 
 the Ngspice development team. Please provide information about your system 
 and any ./configure arguments you are using, together with any error 
 messages.  Ideally you would have tried to fix the problem yourself first.
 If you have fixed the problem then the development team will love to hear 
 from you.

1.3 Basic Install

 This covers installation from a tarball (for example ngspice-rework-18.tgz).
 After downloading the tar ball to a local directory unpack it using:

 $ tar -zxvf ngspice-rework-18.tgz
	
 Now change directories in to the top-level source directory (where this
 INSTALL file can be found).

 You should be able to do:
 
 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ sudo make install
  
 The default install dir is /usr/local/bin

 See the section titled 'Advanced Install' for instructions about arguments 
 that can be passed to ./configure to customise the build and installation.


1.4 Advanced Install

 Some extra options can be provided to './configure'. To get all available
 options do:

 $ ./configure --help
	
 Some of these options are generic to the GNU build process that is used by
 Ngspice, other are specific to Ngspice.

 The following sections provide some guidance and descriptions for many,
 but not all, of these options.


1.4.1 Options Specific to Using Ngspice

  --enable-adms
                ADMS is an experimental model compiler that translates 
                Verilog-A compact models into C code that can be compiled into 
                ngspice. This is (as of rework.18 )still experimental and not
                completely working. If you want to use it, please refer to the
                ADMS section on ngspice web site.

 --enable-capbypass
		Bypass calculation of cbd/cbs in the mosfets if the vbs/vbd 
		voltages are unchanged.
		
 --enable-capzerobypass
 		Bypass all the cbd/cbs calculations if Czero is zero. This is 
                enabled by default since rework-18.

 --enable-cider
                Cider is a mixed-level simulator that couples Spice3 and DSIM
                to simulate devices from their technological parameters. This
                part of the simulator is not compiled by default.

 --enable-cluster
                Clustering code for distributed simulation. This is a
                contribution never tested. This code comes from TCLspice
                implementation and is implemented for transient analysis only.

 --enable-expdevices     
                Enable experimental devices. This option is used by developers 
                to mask devices under development. Almost useless for users.

 --enable-experimental
		This enables some experimental code. Specifically it enables:
			* support for altering options in interactive mode 
			  by adding the interactive keyword 'options'.
			* The ability to save and load snapshots: adds 
			  interactive keywords 'savesnap' and 'loadsnap'.

 --enable-help           
                Force building nghelp. This is deprecated.

 --enable-ndev
		Enable NDEV interface, (experimental)
		A TCP/IP interface to external device simulator such as GSS.
		For more information, please visit the homepage of GSS at 
		http://gss-tcad.sourceforge.net
 
 --enable-newpred
                Enable the NEWPRED symbol in the code.

 --enable-newtrunc
		Enable the newtrunc option

 --enable-nodelimiting
 		Experimental damping scheme

 --enable-nobypass
		Don't bypass recalculations of slowly changing variables

 --enable-nosqrt
		Use always log/exp for non-linear capacitances
 		
 --enable-predictor
 		Enable a predictor method for convergence
		
 --enable-sense2
		Use spice2 sensitivity analysis

 --enable-xgraph
		Compile the Xgraph plotting program.
		Xgraph is a plotting package for X11 and was once very popular.
				
 --enable-xspice
		Enable XSpice enhancements, (experimental)
		A mixed signal simulator built upon spice3 with codemodel 
		dynamic loading support.  See src/xspice/README for details.
		
 --with-editline=yes
		Enables the use of the BSD editline library (libedit).
		See http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/
		This is preferred over GNU readline due to licensing issues.

 --with-readline=yes
		Enable GNU readline support for the command line interface.
		This requires linking against the GNU readline library and 
		is discouraged.
 
 --with-tcl=tcldir
                When configured with this option the tcl module 
                "tclspice" is compiled and installed instead of
                plain ngspice.


1.4.2 Options Useful for Debugging Ngspice

 --enable-ansi
                Configure will try to find an option for your compiler so that
		it expects ansi-C.

--enable-asdebug
		Debug sensitivity code *ASDEBUG*.

 --enable-blktmsdebug    
                Debug distortion code *BLOCKTIMES*

 --enable-checkergcc
		Option for compilation with checkergcc.

 --enable-cpdebug
		Enable ngspice shell code debug.

 --disable-debug
		This option will remove the '-g' option passed to the compiler.
		This speeds up compilation a *lot*, and is recommended for 
		normal use.

 --enable-ftedebug
		Enable ngspice frontend debug.
		
 --enable-gc
		Enable the Boehm-Weiser Conservative Garbage Collector.

 --enable-pzdebug
		Debug pole/zero code.
		
 --enable-sensdebug
                Debug sensitivity code *SENSDEBUG*.

 --enable-smltmsdebug
		Debug distortion code *SMALLTIMES*

 --enable-smoketest
		Enable smoketest compile.
	
 --enable-stepdebug
		Turns on debugging of convergence stepping??
		
		
1.5 Compilation using an user defined directory tree for object files	

	The procedures described above will store the *.o files (output  
 of the compilation step) into the directories where the sources (*.c) 
 are located. This may not be the best option if you want for example 
 to have a debug version and in parallel a release version of ngspice
 (./configure option --disable-debug). 
 
 So if you intend to create a separate object file tree like 
 ng-spice-rework/ngbuild/release, you may do the following, starting 
 from the default directory ng-spice-rework:
 
 mkdir -p ngbuild/release
 cd ngbuild/release
 ../../configure <some options>	
 make install
 
 This will create an object file directory tree, similar to the source 
 file directory tree, the object files are now separated from the source 
 files. For the debug version, you may do the same as described above, 
 replacing 'release' by 'debug', and obtain another separated object 
 file directory tree. 
 
 If you already have run ./configure in ng-spice-rework, you have to do a
 maintainer-clean, before the above procedure will work.
 
 Unfortunately this procedure will not work with Xspice enabled, so your 
 options should not include --enable-xspice. This bug will be removed in a 
 future version of ngspice.
 

2 Compilers and Options
  =====================

     Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
 the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
 initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
 a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
 this:
      CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

 Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

3 Compiling For Multiple Architectures
  ====================================

     You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
 same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
 own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
 supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
 directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
 the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
 source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

     If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
 variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
 in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
 one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
 architecture.

4 Installation Names
  ==================

    By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
 `/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
 installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
 option `--prefix=PATH'.

    You can specify separate installation prefixes for
 architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
 give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
 PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
 Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

    In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
 options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
 kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
 you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

    If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
 with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
 option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

 When installed on MinGW with MSYS alternative paths are not fully supported.
 See 'How to make ngspice with MINGW and MSYS' below for details.


5 Optional Features
  =================

    Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
 `configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
 They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
 is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
 `README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
 package recognizes.

    For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
 find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
 you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
 `--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

6 Specifying the System Type
  ==========================

    There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
 automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
 will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
 a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
 `--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
 type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
      CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

     See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
 `config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
 need to know the host type.

    If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
 use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
 produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
 system on which you are compiling the package.

7 Sharing Defaults
  ================

    If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
 you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
 default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
 `configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
 `PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
 `CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
 A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

8 Operation Controls
  ==================

    `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
 operates.

 `--cache-file=FILE'
      Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
      `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
      debugging `configure'.

 `--help'
      Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

 `--quiet'
 `--silent'
 `-q'
      Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
      suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
      messages will still be shown).

 `--srcdir=DIR'
      Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
      `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

 `--version'
      Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
      script, and exit.

 `configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.



9 NGSPICE COMPILATION UNDER WINDOWS OS
  ====================================

9.1 How to make ngspice with MINGW and MSYS
  
     Creating ngspice with MINGW is now a straight forward procedure,
 if you have MSYS/MINGW installed properly. Unfortunately this is rather 
 tedious because you will need several enhancements to the standard install,
 especially if you want to include XSpice. Some links are given below which 
 describe the procedures.
  
     The default installation location of ngspice is the Windows path
 C:\spice. The install path can be altered by passing --prefix=NEWPATH
 as an argument to ./configure during the build process.

     Put the install path you desire inside "", e.g. "D:/NewSpice". Be  
 careful to use forward slashes "/", not backward slashes "\" (something 
 still to be fixed).  Then add --prefix="D:/NewSpice" as an argument to 
 ./configure in the normal way.

 The procedure of compiling a distribution (for example, a tarball from
 the ngspice website), is as follows:

 $ cd ng-spice-rework-18
 $ ./configure --with-windows ...and other options
 $ make
 $ make install

 The useful options are:
 --enable-xspice (this requires FLEX and BISON available in MSYS, see below).
 --enable-cider
 --disable-debug (-O2 optimization, no debug information)

 However, to compile code extracted from the CVS repository the procedure is
 a little different, thus:

 $ cd ng-spice-rework-18
 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode --with-windows ...and other options
 $ make
 $ make install

 MINGW and MSYS can be downloaded from http://www.mingw.org/. The making of 
 the code models *.cm for XSpice requires installation of BISON and FLEX to
 MSYS. A typical installation was tested with:
 
 bison-2.0-MSYS.tar.gz
 flex-2.5.4a-1-bin.zip
 libiconv-1.9.2-1-bin.zip
 libintl-0.14.4-bin.zip

 Bison 2.0 is now superseeded by newer releases (Bison 2.3, see 
 http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=67879)

 The last three are from 
 http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23617.

9.2 make ngspice with MS Visual Studio 2008

 ngspice may now be compiled with MS Visual Studio 2008.

 CIDER and XSPICE are included, but the code models for XSPICE
 (*.cm) are not (yet) made. You may however use the code models
 created with MINGW (which in fact are dlls), as e.g. found in
 the ngspice binary distribution.
  
 There is currently no installation procedure provided, you may
 however install the executable manually as described in the
 installation tree below.
 
     The directory (visualc) with its files 
 vngspice.sln (project starter) and
 vngspice.vcproj (project contents)
 allows to compile and link ngspice with MS Visual Studio 2008.
 The project is probably not compatible with Visual Studio 2005.
 
 /visualc/include contains a dedicated config.h file. It contains the
 preprocessor definitions required to properly compile the code.
 strings.h has been necessary during setting up the project.
 
 Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 C++ . The
 MS VS 2008 C++ Express Edition (which is available at no cost from
 http://www.microsoft.com/express/product/default.aspx) is adequate.
 
 Goto  /ng-spice-rework/visualc.
 
 Start MS Visual Studio 2008 by double click onto vngspice.sln.
 
 After MS Visual Studio has opened up, select debug or release version 
 by checking 'Erstellen' , 'Konfigurations-Manager' 'Debug' or 'Release'.
 
 Start making ngspice (called vngspice.exe) by selecting 'Erstellen' and 
 'vngspice neu erstellen'.
 
 Object files will be created and stored in visualc/debug or visualc/release.
 The executable will be stored to visualc/debug/bin or visualc/release/bin.
 
 An installation tree (as provided with MINGW make install) and also used by
 vngspice is (maybe created manually):
 
 C:\Spice\
	bin\
		ngspice.exe
		nghelp.exe
		ngmakeidx.exe
		ngnutmeg.exe
		cmpp.exe
	lib\
		spice\
			analog.cm
			digital.cm
			spice2poly.cm
			extradev.cm
			extravt.cm
	share\
		info\
			dir
			ngspice.info
			ngspice.info-1
			..
			ngspice.info-10
		man\
			man1\
				ngmultidec.1
				ngnutmeg.1
				ngsconvert.1
				ngspice.1
		ng-spice-rework\
			helpdir\
				ngspice.idx
				ngspice.txt
			scripts\
				ciderinit
				devaxis
				devload
				setplot
				spectrum
				spinit
		
 If you intend to install vngspice into another directory, e.g. D:\MySpice,
 you have to edit  /visualc/include/config.h and alter the entries:
 #define NGSPICEBINDIR "C:/Spice/bin"
 #define NGSPICEDATADIR "C:/Spice/share/ng-spice-rework"
 to
 #define NGSPICEBINDIR "D:/MySpice/bin"
 #define NGSPICEDATADIR "D:/MySpice/share/ng-spice-rework" 
  
 nghelp.exe is deprecated and no longer offered, but still available in the binary
 distribution.
 
 If the code model files *.cm are not available, you will get warning messages,
 but you may use ngspice in the normal way (of course without XSPICE extensions). 
 
 ToDo: Some commands in how-to-ngspice-vstudio.txt and mentioned above
 have to be translated to English.


9.3 make ngspice with pure CYGWIN

 If you don't have libdl.a you may need to link libcygwin.a 
 to libdl.a symbolically.

 for example:

 $ cd /lib
 $ ln -s libcygwin.a libdl.a.

 The procedure of compiling is the same as Linux.


The next two compilation options (9.4, and 9.5) are deprecated and not tested. 
 
 9.4 make ngspice with CYGWIN and external MINGW32

 according to http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/6013/0/7321042/


 $ cd ng-spice-rework-18
 $ export PATH="/cygdrive/g/gcc_mingw/bin:$PATH"
 $ autoconf
 $ rm config.cache
 $ ./configure --with-windows --prefix="/cygdrive/g/gcc_mingw/bin"
 $ make clean
 $ make 2> make.err

 $ cp config.h config_ming.h

 ngspice.exe is o.k.,but make tests does not work (cannot direct console
 output into file). Needs to add .save "what" "where.test" to every input 
 (*.cir) file. Also all given output files have to be adapted to WINDOWS 
 (CR/LF instead of only LF at each line ending) for allowing proper comparison.


 9.5 make ngspice with CYGWIN and internal MINGW32 (use config.h made above)

 $ cd ng-spice-rework-18
 $ rm config.cache
 $ export CFLAGS="-mno-cygwin -g -O2"
 $ export LDFLAGS="-L/lib/mingw"
 $ export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/include/mingw"
 $ ./configure --with-windows
 $ cp config_ming.h config.h
 $ make clean
 $ make 2> make.err

 ./configure does not work correctly: It finds headers and libs which are not 
 really available in the -mno-cygwin port of MINGW32. Therefore config.h is 
 not o.k.

 ToDo: find appropriate presets for variables ?
       rewrite tests for headers and libs (search exclusively in mingw
       directories)
